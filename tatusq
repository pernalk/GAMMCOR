[33m33799c4[m fixing the problem when some active orbitals are unoccupied (n_p=0). a new procedure (read_nact_molpro(nact,'2RDM')) has been created for reading the number of active orbitals from the molpro file. it is called from LdInteg. if the number of partially occupied orbitals (NAc) is different from the number of active orbitals nact (read from molpro) NAc is set to nact and a warning message is printed.
[33m0981637[m new dfun_GGA_AB subroutine for computatin of GGA xc functional for alpha and beta inputs (in xcfun.f90). new GGA_ONTOP subroutine. in RunDFOnTop (Gagliardi method) a Call to SR_PBE_ONTOP (with omega=1.D-12) has been replaced with GGA_ONTOP. PBE is used but it can be changed to another functional in dfun_GGA_AB.
