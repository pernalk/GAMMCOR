## 🧪 Testing
### 🔧 Preparation
1. Define _gitos_ in your `~/.ssh/config` file:
```
Host gitos
  HostName 172.20.50.110
  User git
  Port 22
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<public_key_name>
```
* If you do not have a key, please contact the server administrator. 
2. Obtain test input files from repository:
```
git clone gitos:qchem/TESTS
```
3. Open _gammcor_verify.bash_ in the main GAMMCOR directory and assign variable ```TEST_SCRIPT_PATH``` the path to the file ```run_test.py``` located in your TESTS directory

### ✋ Manual testing
Run test script located in the main GAMMCOR directory:
```
./gammcor_verify.bash
```

### 🚦 Automatic testing
* ##### Enabling
1. Go to ```GAMMCOR/auto_test``` directory
2. Run ```./install-hooks.bash``` to install test scripts: ```pre-commit.bash```, ```pre-push.bash``` and ```post-merge.bash```
3. From now on, the tests will be performed before each ```commit``` and ```push``` commands as well as after the ```merge``` command

* ##### Skipping
To bypass ```pre-commit``` or ```pre-push``` tests, you can use ```--no-verify``` option, e.g.
```
git commit --no-verify
```

* ##### Disabling
To permanently disable the automatic testing feature, go to ```GAMMCOR/auto_test``` directory and run ```./uninstall-hooks.bash```

* ##### Adjusting the level of testing
To customize the list of tests performed for a given _git_ command, you can change level parameter passed to ```gammcor_verify.bash``` in ```pre-commit.bash```, ```pre-push.bash``` and ```post-merge.bash``` scripts. There are three levels: ```'short'```, ```'long'``` and ```'full'``` (default), which correspond to the levels defined for individual tests listed in ```TESTS/scripts/test_list.py```.
* ```'full'``` will perfom tests with ```'full'```, ```'long'``` and ```'short'``` levels
* ```'long'``` will perfom tests with ```'long'``` and ```'short'``` levels
* ```'short'``` will only perfom tests with ```'short'``` level
